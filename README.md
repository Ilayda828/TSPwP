# TSPwP
An algorithm project that develops approaches for the Penalized Traveling Salesman Problem, aiming to minimize the sum of the tour length and the penalties of the cities skipped.

ðŸ“Œ What is the Subject of the Project?
In this project, you are given a group of cities (points). Each city has a coordinate (x, y) on the 2D plane. Visiting each city has a cost (distance between two cities), and not visiting a city gives you a fixed penalty.

So there are two options:

Visit the city and increase the tour length.

Skip the city and pay a fixed penalty.

The aim is to minimize the value of:

Total tour length + sum of penalties of skipped cities by balancing these two effects.

ðŸ“Œ What was done in the Project?
You are asked to visit some of the cities and find the most suitable route.

The route will be a tour: starting from the first city, visiting the cities in order and returning to the starting point.

A fixed penalty point is added for each city not visited.

You will design the algorithm that finds the best (or close to good) solution.

An optimal solution is not mandatory, but a logical and fast-working approach is expected.
